The final project for CCCS102. 

---

### FINPROJECT01.cpp

**OH MY GAS:**  

Simulates a gas station pump where the user can set the price per
gallon and dispense a user-specified amount of fuel. The program
tracks the amount dispensed and total charged, with display and
control functionality through a `GasPump` class.

### FINPROJECT02.cpp

**VEGGIE-BOXIE:**  

Randomly fills a box with three produce items selected from a list
(provided in `produce.txt`). Users can view and optionally substitute
items in the box, demonstrating file input, random selection, and
array manipulation.

### FINPROJECT03.cpp
**TARGET-HEART-RATE-CALCULATOR:**  

Collects personal details (name and birthday) to compute age, maximum
heart rate, and target heart rate range using a `HeartRates`
class. Uses ANSI codes for styled terminal output.

---

### FINPROJECT04.cpp

**COMPUTERIZATION OF HEALTH RECORDS:**  

Prompts for patient data (including name, gender, birthday, height,
and weight), then calculates age, BMI, and heart rate information
using a `HealthProfile` class. Results are displayed in a formatted
summary.

---

### FINPROJECT05.cpp

**PIZZA-BABY:**  

Lets users enter information for several pizzas (topping and
diameter), sets the price based on size, and then displays a summary
of all pizzas. Demonstrates use of classes, arrays, and simple
business logic for pricing.

---

### FINPROJECT06.cpp

**THE SECRET MESSAGE:**  

Implements a basic square transposition cipher: takes a user message
(up to 81 characters), arranges it in a square grid, and prints the
ciphered text by reading columns. Demonstrates character arrays and
text manipulation.
